HOW TO RUN CODES

The R scripts should be run in the following order
1. cleaning
2. statistics
3. regression

The description of what each script does is written at the start. The script "variables.R" is wrapped in the scripts "statistics.R" and "regression.R" so there is no need to run it separately.
